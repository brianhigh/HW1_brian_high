## Let's load ggplot2 and iris dataset

```{r, excho=TRUE}
suppressMessages(library(ggplot2))
data(iris)
```

We will then compare the use of reshape2 and dplyr/tidyr for data tidying.

## Reshaping your data with reshape2

It is often necessary to reshape (e.g. pivot) your data before analysis. This can easily be done in R using the `reshape2` package.
This package provides main functions `melt` and `*cast`. `melt` basically "melts" a dataframe in wide format into a long format. `*cast` goes in the other direction.

## Reshaping your data with reshape2

Let's revisit our `iris` dataset.
```{r reshape2}
# We first load the library
suppressMessages(library(reshape2))
# Only display the first few lines
head(iris)
```

We can see in the data above that we are measuring both width and length on two different flower characteristics: Sepal, and Petal. So we could store the same information with only one length (resp. width) column and an additional variable for type (Sepal/Petal). 

## reshape2 - melt

The `melt` function provides some good default options that will try to best guess how to "melt" the data.

```{r reshape2-melt}
# We first need to add a column to keep track of the flower
iris$flower_id <- rownames(iris)
# Default options
iris_melted <- melt(iris)
head(iris_melted)
```

## dyplr - mutate

We can also add the flower_id column with dplyr's `mutate` function:

```{r dplyr-mutate}
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
# We need to add a column to keep track of the flower
iris_id <- mutate(iris, flower_id = rownames(iris))
head(iris_id)
```

## tidyr - gather

Then we can use tidyr and `gather` instead of reshape2 and `melt`:

```{r, tidyr-gather}
suppressMessages(library(tidyr))
iris_gathered <- gather(iris_id, variable, value, c(-Species, -flower_id))
head(iris_gathered)
```

## reshape2 - melt

We would like to be able to group observations by the flower part Sepal and Petal) and compare them. We need to parse the column names containing the flower part (and measurement type) and store them as values instead.

```{r reshape2-melt-suite}
# We first split that variable to get the columns we need
split_variable <- strsplit(as.character(iris_melted$variable),split="\\.")
# Create two new variables
iris_melted$flower_part <- sapply(split_variable, "[", 1)
iris_melted$measurement_type <- sapply(split_variable, "[", 2)
# Remove the one we don't need anymore
iris_melted$variable <- NULL
head(iris_melted)
```

## Mutate and gsub

Likewise, using our "gathered" data, we can use dplyr's `mutate` function and `gsub` (from base R) to search and replace (with "regular expressions").

```{r dplyr-mutate-and-gsub}
# Add new columns for the parsed values, remove the variable column
iris_parsed <- mutate(iris_gathered, 
    flower_part = gsub("(\\w*)\\.\\w*", "\\1", variable), 
    measurement_type = gsub("\\w*\\.(\\w*)", "\\1", variable),
    variable = NULL)
head(iris_parsed)
```

## reshape2 - cast

Use `acast` or `dcast` depending on whether you want vector/matrix/array output or data frame output. Data frames can have at most two dimensions.

```{r reshape2-cast}
iris_cast <- dcast(iris_melted, formula=flower_id+Species+flower_part~measurement_type)
head(iris_cast)
```

**Q:** Why are the elements of `flower_id` not properly ordered?

`melt` and `*cast` are very powerful. These can also be used on `data.tables`. More on this latter.

**Exercise:** Try to reorder the variable names in the formula. What happens?

## tidyr - spread

And here is the same transformation using `spread` with the tidyr "parsed" data ...

```{r tidyr-spread}
iris_spread <- spread(iris_parsed, measurement_type, value)
head(iris_spread)
```

## Back to ggplot2

Using our long format dataframe, we can further explore the iris dataset.

```{r multi-facet, fig.height=4}
# We can now facet by Species and Petal/Sepal
qplot(x=Width, y=Length, data=iris_cast, geom=c("point","smooth"), color=Species, method="lm", facets= flower_part~Species)
```

It would be nice to see if we could have free scales for the panels, but before we explore this, let's talk about the `ggplot` API as an alternative to qplot. Can we also customize the look and feel?

## Back to ggplot2 - tidyr

And we can compare that plot with one using the data prepared with dplyr and tidyr...

```{r multi-facet-tidyr, fig.height=4}
qplot(x=Width, y=Length, data=iris_spread, geom=c("point","smooth"), color=Species, method="lm", facets= flower_part~Species)
```

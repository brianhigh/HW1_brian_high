While the [assignment](https://github.com/raphg/Biostat-578/blob/master/HW1.md) 
was to produce an Rmd file to produce a certain plot, 
this repo contains something a little different.

- The plot produced is not the same plot as required for your homework.
- A number of other files are included.

This is a file list:

- Tidyr_Example.Rmd: Compares Reshape2 and Dplyr/Tidyr
- dplyr_and_tidyr_demo.R: R script showing just the Dplyr/Tidyr demo
- dplyr_and_tidyr_demo.Rmd: Rmd file created by running the R script
- dplyr_and_tidyr_demo.md: md file created by knitting the Rmd file. 
- dplyr_and_tidyr_demo.html: HTML file created by knitting the Rmd file.

# HW1_brian_high

This is an example homework #1 for BIOST 578 A, Winter 2015.

- Reviewer: Jane Smith
- Group: 14

While the [assignment](https://github.com/raphg/Biostat-578/blob/master/HW1.md) 
was to create an **Rmd file** to produce a certain plot, 
this repo contains something a little different.

- A number of other files are included, including some other plots.
- Tidyr and Dplyr was used instead of Reshape2.

This is a file list:

- Tidyr_Example.Rmd: Compares Reshape2 and Dplyr/Tidyr
- dplyr_and_tidyr_demo.R: R script showing just the Dplyr/Tidyr demo
- **dplyr_and_tidyr_demo.Rmd**: Rmd file created by running the R script (and some manual formatting)
- dplyr_and_tidyr_demo.md: Markdown file created by knitting the Rmd file
- dplyr_and_tidyr_demo.html: HTML file created by knitting the Rmd file
